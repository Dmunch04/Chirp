# Chirp
A modern low-level programming language written in C++, to replace C++ and other old languages, but it's still pretty bad right now.

# Simple Example
```chirp
int start()
{
int: a
}
```
As you can see this is weird.

# Build instructions
This should run on any modern C++ compiler, the only library used is the standard library

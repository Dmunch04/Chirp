Chirp is a modern low-level programming language written in C++. Currently the language is still very early and can barely run yet, but I am actively working on the compiler, and hope one day it will be a functionning language.

<br>

### Simple Example

```chirp
  entry int start ()
  {
    # Assign 123 to the variable "a", which is an int
    int: a = 123
  }
```

### Documentation

Chirp's documentation is currently being written, but there's enough for you to get an idea of how the language works. If you want help on building Chirp and getting started, check out [Getting Started](https://github.com/binkiklou/Chirp-Website/blob/master/Website/Documentation/Getting%20Started.md). You can find all documentation at this site: [Documentation Website](http://munchii.me/chirp), or at [our documentation repo](https://github.com/binkiklou/Chirp-Website/blob/master/Website/Documentation/)!

> The documentation website will be switched with a custom URL soon

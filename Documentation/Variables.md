## Variables

Chirp, like any other programming language, has variales. In chirp there's 4 different value types:
 - `int`
 - `float`
 - `char`
 - `string`

### Examples

```chirp
  int: a = 13
```
The code above, sets the variable `a` to int `13`

A cool feature of Chirp is, unlike in C/C++, strings are natives and don't have to be imported. This is demonstrated in the code below:
```chirp
  string: name = "Maxence"
```
That works perfectly fine. You don't have to import anything!

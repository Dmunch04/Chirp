## Contribute

If you find an issue then please report it using GitHub Issues. If you find anything in the docs, that's grammatically incorrect or just sounds weird, then feel free to do a pull request and fix it. Neither Bink or I are native english speakers, so it would be great if you would correct us if we make an mistake or if something isn't proberly written!

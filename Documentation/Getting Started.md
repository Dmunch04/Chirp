# Getting started with chirp
This isn't about the source code, this documentation is for the programming language.

## Basic code
So let's get started with basic code, below is some basic code with C++:
``` cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout<<"This works!"<<std::endl;
	return 0;
}
```
Now with Chirp the code above would look like this
```chirp 
print("This works!")
```
The Chirp code works much better than the C++ code.

## Variables
Chirp like any other programming language has variales. In chirp the variables have 4 types, ``int``,``float``,``char`` and ``string``. Unlike in C/C++ strings are  natives and don't have to be included.

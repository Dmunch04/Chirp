| Hmm | `N/A` | `chirp/lexer/token.d:45` |
| Other naming convention? | `N/A` | `chirp/lexer/token.d:51` |
| Should this be a string? It would really be like `Object` or `any` | `N/A` | `chirp/lexer/token.d:87` |
| Maybe not the best handling? | `N/A` | `chirp/lexer/lexer.d:97` |
| Make better logging system. Both for compilation errors, but also CLI errors | `N/A` | `chirp/program.d:11` |

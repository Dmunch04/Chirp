| Hmm | `N/A` | `chirp/lexer/token.d:44` |
| Other naming convention? | `N/A` | `chirp/lexer/token.d:50` |
| Should this be a string? It would really be like `Object` or `any` | `N/A` | `chirp/lexer/token.d:82` |
| How do we check to see if this actually works lol. In the `profilegc.log` it doesn't seem to take affect | `N/A` | `chirp/lexer/lexer.d:24` |
| Don't actually free this here. But is it even needed to free it? | `N/A` | `chirp/lexer/lexer.d:26` |

# Chirp's contribution guide

## What we are looking for

To make the project go progress further we are looking for and priorize the following.

* Translation, improvement and writing of more documentation
* Minor and Major bug fixes
* Modification of existing code to make it better or more efficient
* Cross-platform code or ports of existing code
* Additionsts to the language, that respect the existing grammar rules

## How to help

If you have any experience with the software and you think there is something missing or you encountered a glitch, then you can open an
issue. If you feel like you really want to help, you can even make your own fork and fix the bug there, when you are finished you can
create a pull request, and if we judge it is a valuable addition to the repository, it will be merged.

When contributing, you should make complete pull requests. If you contribution is affecting the source code you should **always** write
documentation or adjust the existing one to be adapted to your change. If it is particulary major, you need to write new documentation
to help the other contributers and users of the language.
